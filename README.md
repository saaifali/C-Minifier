CSS Minifier
==========

A basic, portable CSS minifier which makes minified CSS files for faster access and lowering memory space usage.

This basically trims whitespace and removes comments. It doesn't do any lexical analyzing, so complex or twisted cases may make it fail.


Requirements
============

- Python 2.7.6 and higher


Use
===

- `python cssmin.py`
Then the GUI opens up. Browse for the given CSS file.
Click on the minify button to minify the CSS file.
The minified css file is stored with the extension _min.css

Example
=======

Given the following input file, `style.css`

The output file is `style_min.css`.
